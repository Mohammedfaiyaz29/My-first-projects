# My First HTML Form Project

This is my first project, where I've created a simple HTML form. It's a beginner's project to get started with web development. 

## Overview

- I've created a basic HTML form that includes input fields for name, email, and a message.
- The form is designed to help me practice HTML and learn how to capture user input.
